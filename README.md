Granny's Bakery is a short story-driven game where the player helps out at their grandma's Bakery in the countryside after leaving home in the city because of a family disagreement. The player meets customers around the bakery and each day that the player fulfills an order, they unlock a character's story line. After all the story lines are unlocked for a character one ending out of four can be achieved. The player can also buy items from the shop system to unlock two potential epilogues. Some of the commands feature: bakery management, daily rewards system with a weekly bonus reward, economy, leaderboards, etc. Player data is stored for each Discord server using MongoDB (NoSQL).
